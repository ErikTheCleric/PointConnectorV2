# PointConnectorV2
The second version of the PointConnector project with more added features!
Different from the last project in many ways for example, the ability to place the points where you like, rather tham them being random. Along with that, PointConnectorV2 is a playground for experimenting Dijsktra's Algorithm and other shortest path algorithms.
